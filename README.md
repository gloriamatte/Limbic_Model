# Limbic Model
training brain sex model on limbic structures

This repository contains the training function to train the model and an application example. 

The list of structures included as limbic features can be found in the supplementary information of the paper, including the FreeSurfer name for them.
The same function (trainClassificationModel) with different set of features can be used to train the non-limbic and the whole brain model.

The subject selection criteria for HCP data can also be found in the supplementary information of the paper. For the matching procedure, the package MatchIt was used.
